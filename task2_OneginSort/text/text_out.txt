     a ball here, there a children's party;
     a cheerful glimmer on the snow
     a corpse on boards was all he found,
     across our snows of northern bleakness
     across the Baltic in exchange
     across the public's toes; he steers
     across the stage; he yawns: ``Ballet --

     And Eugene? half-awake, half-drowsing,
     and every day its own enjoyment?
     And every morning I awake
     and everything is cramped and loud;
     and fastens, like a term of art,
     and fatherland and grim confinement?

     as if some goal had been achieved.
     as I recall a bygone age?
     a stride on Petrarch's path, allayed

     brushes on thirty different scales;
     but by and large their talk's a hash
     But, did they not corrupt society,
     but Eugene's out from din and press:

     but I, in love, was dull and dumb.

     So, like Childe Harold, glum, unpleasing,
     Some days he's still in bed, and drowses,
     some ladies preach from Say and Bentham,
     something like spleen, that scourge of Britain,
     sometimes, in reverie's sacred land,
     So now be off to Neva's brink,
     soon, infidelity proved cloying,
     so pious, and so clever too,
     so pure, so spotless through and through,
     so virtuous that, no sooner seen,
     spurs of Chevalier Gardes are clinking,
     spying my features, as he could,
     stalking the momentary weakness,
     2 Stanzas IX, XIII, XIV, XXXIX, XL and XLI were omitted by Pushkin.
     startling the ingenuous with a jest,
     still coughing, hissing, clapping, champing;
     still everywhere the lamps are bright;
     Still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,
     still shivering in the bitter weather
     Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid
     straight to his stall, then turns his glasses
     struck for Evgeny, with its play
     stumblingly call to mind he did
     such crystalled scents as best are able
     such shadowy and leisured ways,
     Such were a young rake's meditations --
     swam on the river's dreaming face,
     swaying the artless, waiting on
     taken your place, though not your throne?
     thank God, he had no inclination
     that alien scene must I now turn
     that all of Russia can't contribute
     that even so my wretched style
     That isn't our immediate worry:
     that king of the satiric scene,
     that, like proud Byron, I can draw
     that once I spent my happiest days?
     that stretched from Romulus in his prime
     That's when I'll sit down to compose
     that's where my years of youth were spent.
     that there his friend Kavérin's5 waiting;
     that world where every man's a critic
     the ancients have gone stiff and cold,
     the art he'd studied best of all,
     the atmosphere of youth and madness,
     the audience still is busy stamping,
     18 ``The  author, on  his mother's  side,  is of  African  descent...''
     the ballroom drove me off my head:
     the barbs that envy's always spreading,
     The bitterness was mine -- the ice
     the blood within my withered heart,
     the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;
     the brilliant crackpot: this reaction
     the cabinet behind the door
     The censor's tribute, I'll arrange:
     the charge that poets are unable
     The city's early sounds awake her;
     the coachmen ring the fire, and curse
     the coolness of the sombre glade,
     the crush, the glitter and the gladness,
     the expanse of fields, so wide, so lonely,
     the flaming roses of a cheek,
     the footmen sleep on the pelisses;
     the gallery claps -- it's bored with waiting --
     the gift of recognizing what
     The happiness of youth is dead,
     the heartache that they bring lies deep.
     the heart of the professional flirt!
     the hero's name's decided too.
     the highest circles are a bore.
     the horses fidget worse and worse;
     The house is packed out; scintillating,
     The illness with which he'd been smitten
     the indifferent, or the deadly serious!
     their looks and language in deceit
     their lords, and thwack their palms together;
     the ladies' calculated dress;
     the legatee of his relations --
     the magic voices of your stream,
     the meaning of an epigraph,
     the merchant's up, the cabman's walking
     the moderns rage against the old.
     the mountain maiden,19 my ideal,
     the murmur where the streamlet played...
     Then, after midday he'll be waking;
     then afterwards, alone, at ease,

     the new ballet he should be at.
     then from his cabinet he'll pass
     then from the Muse there came revival:
     then he'd implore a declaration,
     then suddenly she's off, and there
     Then with a half-ethereal splendour,
     the pangs with which his heart was troubled,
     the poet's only theme is ``I.''
     there caustic Shakhovskóy8 came in
     there Didelot10 crowned himself with glory:
     there gathered at the coffin-side
     There once I too strolled back and forth:
     there's far too much of contradiction,
     there waited for us both the malice
     there, where the coulisse entrance went,
     there сzerov8 shared the unwilling
     the safest place for declarations,
     these words are not of Russian stock:
     the silence when our talk had ceased!
     the strain of Tasso's octave-rhyme!
     the subtle spouse was just as loyal --
     the sumptuous palais shines out;
     the third day, wood and hill and grazing
     the thought of volatile renown.
     the tongue of love and of Petrarch.
     the total ownership of woods,
     the usurers' voracious tribe.
     the wilful fancies of the heart.

     they buried Uncle, congregated
     they don't deserve what they inspire
     they're all chained up in different fetters,
     this child of luxury and delight.
     this denizen of the coulisses
     this was the science of that passion
     though cold I am and sad; in sleep
     though years ago I used to look
     three pairs of handsome ones -- yet there
     Three whole hours, at the least accounting,
     through it they're known to me, and kin.

     to all the most adored actrices,
     to blow his brains out, but in stead
     to do them all is easy game.
     to drive the swooning senses mad;
     to drown the hiss of modish wives.
     to eat and drink, then separated
     to freedom, softness and enjoyment:
     to gentlemen on every side
     To harmless idleness devoted,
     to hear what latest modes require,
     to hide a hope, to make a show
     to his disputing and his cursing;
     to kiss Armida's lips, or seek
     to know the audience hears his voice.
     to lie down at her feet like slaves!
     to life grew colder than the dead.
          To live, it hurries, and to feel it hastes.
     tomorrow just like yesterday.
     to mourn for Russia's gloomy savour,
     to pass for cultured in our ranks.
     To private tastes we each subscribe:
     to scorn the men with whom he deals;
     to sing of others must imply
     to smother her dear feet with kissing.
     to the beginning of our days.

     To whom do you, from all the train

     Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
     in Adam Smith was his diploma;
     Diana's breast, the cheeks of Flora,
the Neva.''
     it was goodbye, Monsieur l'Abbé.
     but I, in love, was dull and dumb.
     and telling trochee from iambic
     He was without that dithyrambic
     that world where every man's a critic
     boo Phaedra out as paralytic,
     to life grew colder than the dead.
     of entertaining the half-dead:
     The happiness of youth is dead,
     the ballroom drove me off my head:
     just like, on turf, your fleeting tread.
     to blow his brains out, but in stead
     to drive the swooning senses mad;
     with amber pipes from Tsaregrad;12
     one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
     At first Onegin's tongue produced
     for his old courses to be changed.
     and glad he was he'd thus arranged
     Oh, when, and to what desert banished,
     My goddesses! Where are you banished?
     have other maidens, since you vanished,
     my little feet, where have you vanished,
     he's dreadfully dissatisfied;
     you left no steps that could be tracked:
     fever of rhyme: thereby he's doubled
     the pangs with which his heart was troubled,
     His hair was fashionably curled,
     is in your poetry enshrined?''
     and where most surely notes are sped.
     reader, or where you've shone and glittered!
     Onegin, my good friend, was littered
     our lives were flat, and what had fired
     both hearts to blaze had now expired;
     far, far from Italy, his adored.
     deep in Moldavia the abhorred,
     the silence when our talk had ceased!
     Like convicts in a dream released
     Unforced, as conversation passed,
     a haze in me, but I grew used
     they buried Uncle, congregated
     on waves of far niente floated,
     to eat and drink, then separated
     his bow was wholly unaffected.
     his strangeness, wholly unaffected,
     In French Onegin had perfected
     which held him silently subjected,
     before Onegin there collected
     His father died; and (as expected)
     To harmless idleness devoted,
     but soon the ways we trod were parted
     Eugene would willingly have started
     Eugene turned countryman. He tasted
     till then had been dispersed and wasted --
     with grave goodbyes to the bereaved,
     as if some goal had been achieved.
     a stride on Petrarch's path, allayed
     the murmur where the streamlet played...
     a masculine disguise to aid
     stumblingly call to mind he did
     two verses of the Aeneid.
     Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid
     Still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,
     on springtime grasses of the field,
     under the table's linen shield,
     from her Monsieur took on the child.
     He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
     the ancients have gone stiff and cold,
     the moderns rage against the old.
     and now at last he saw the World.
     spying my features, as he could,
     of calculated slander should,
     for quite a while by fortune's hand.
     I feel a small foot in my hand;
     sometimes, in reverie's sacred land,
     and took a mortgage on his land.
     with me to see an alien strand;
     His father failed to understand
     But you, blest husbands, to the end
     you kept your friendship with our friend:
     custom is despot of mankind.
     can yet keep nail-care much in mind:
     rewards the music of your mind
     pursue his love -- and at one bound
     a corpse on boards was all he found,
     was quite beyond his wit, we found.
     of mind got clarity new-found;
     Istómina,11 thronged all around
     by Naiads, one foot on the ground,
     an offering ready for the ground.
     from Million Street16 came floating round;
     emotion, thought, and magic sound;
     and then a drozhky's clopping sound
     frenzy which wrecks our lives for sound,
     and listen for the heart's first sound,
     which Ovid sang, for which the bard,
     condemned to a lifetime of hard,
     Eugene attends the boulevard,
     and everything is cramped and loud;
     while a mazurka holds the crowd;
     To private tastes we each subscribe:
     the usurers' voracious tribe.

     swam on the river's dreaming face,
     and then, with an enchanting grace,
     The bitterness was mine -- the ice
     he'd pop the poison in his chalice!
     was his; we'd both drunk passion's chalice:
     there waited for us both the malice
     what traps he'd set him, with what malice
     encore Moëna,7 -- and rejoice
     to know the audience hears his voice.
     of recompense beyond endurance,
     It fascinates by its assurance
     here's boredom, madness or pretence,
     the coolness of the sombre glade,
     poetry's sacred frenzy, made
     her progress at the masquerade.
     there gathered at the coffin-side
     to gentlemen on every side
     of every funeral far and wide;
     who can combine it with the free
     now sensitive, and now carefree,
     at feasts, was strong and fancy-free?
     or else, from far off, he could see
     and dutifully shared his life
     always contented with his life,
     just like a shadow, or a wife.
     and with his dinner, and his wife.

     I roam by the secluded lake.
     And every morning I awake
     with this the hero of my tale:
     such crystalled scents as best are able
     the charge that poets are unable
     put back the libel on the table
     Porcelain and bronzes on the table,
     When out to burst a rival's bubble,
     of jealousy, to seem to tremble
     How early he'd learnt to dissemble,
     How early on he learnt to trouble
     his epigrams topped up with bile.
     already tends too much to smile
     his virulence that made you smile,
     But God, how deadly dull to sample
     Let others learn from his example!
